# Multi-source-dataset-analysis-on-urban-life-in-the-province-of-Trentino
The purpose of this project is to build a machine learning model capable of predicting the use of Twitter (positions, hours and days of the week of the possible future tweets) in the Province of Trentino with respect to some geolocal features such as weather, wind and tweet positions. This is the final project for the course "Introduction to Data Science for Physicists" of the Physics bachelor's degree of the University of Trento.

In order to run the project, follow the instructions contained into the file info.txt. The dataset was taken from [here](https://www.nature.com/articles/sdata201555).
